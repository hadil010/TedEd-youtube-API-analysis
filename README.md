# TedEd-youtube-API-analysis

As fan of TED-Ed, my curiosity led me to explore what makes their videos unique. Employing the Google YouTube Data API (version 3.0), I collected the metadata associated with their videos. Following this, I proceeded to preprocess the data, introducing additional features to facilitate a more in-depth analysis. Finally, I visualized the data to uncover some pretty cool insights.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Explore Unique Features:** Uncover what makes TED-Ed videos distinctive.
2. **Data Analysis:** Utilize the YouTube Data API to collect and preprocess metadata.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Enhance the dataset with additional features for in-depth analysis.
4. **Data Visualization:** Present insights through visualizations for a clearer understanding.

## Key Sections

1. **Data Creation with Youtube API:** Obtain channel statistics and video details using the YouTube Data API.
2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:** Cleanse and enrich the dataset for effective analysis.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visualize data to reveal patterns and trends.
4. **Data Insights:** Extract key findings and observations from the analysis.


## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and obtain a Google Account for YouTube Data API access.
2. **API Key:** Follow the instructions at [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to create a project and obtain an API key.
3. **Setup:** Clone the repository, install required packages, and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the code with your actual API key.
4. **Exploration:** Dive into Jupyter notebooks for a detailed exploration of the analysis.
